Rock Paper Scissors on UC Fun Kit V4

Programmers - Jack Edwards, Conor McNeill

How to play the game:

1. When the Fun Kit is turned on, the text "ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS - PRESS DOWN TO PLAY" will scroll across the screen. To start the gameplay, press down on the Navigation switch.

2. The boards will now synchronize and display the text "READY?" The person who presses down on the Navigation switch first will be counted as player 1, and the other person will be player 2 for this game.

3. Players can now choose rock, paper, or scissors by pushing the Navigation switch to the left or right, which will cycle through all 3 options continuously. To confirm their decision, players should press the Navigation switch at approximately the same time, as this ensures more consistent IR communication.

4. After a brief delay, the outcome of the round will be displayed. If both boards don't display an outcome, the game will have to be reset as the IR communication failed. The possible outcomes are "LOSE - PRESS DOWN FOR NEXT ROUND", "WIN - PRESS DOWN FOR NEXT ROUND," and "DRAW - PRESS DOWN FOR NEXT ROUND".

5. While on any text display, you can push the Navigation switch downwards to view the current score of the game. You can also return to the currently displayed text by pushing the Navigation switch upwards. This step is optional and not required to continue to the next round.

6. As mentioned in the previous step, you can press the Navigation switch into continue the game to the next round, even when displaying the current score. Again, it's recommended for players to press around the same time to maintain consistent IR communication.

7. Steps 3 to 6 are then repeated indefinitely for however many games you wish to play, with step 5 being optionally accessible whenever there is a text display.
